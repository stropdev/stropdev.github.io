# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-05

The restructure release. All four waves of `plans/0014` landed: the
editor's centre is identity-typed and selection-unified, the input layer
is becoming data, and git is a data model, not a sidebar.

### Changed (architecture)

- **Generational document ids** (`strop_core::id::Arena`): buffers,
  panes, marks, jumplist, surfaces, hunk origins, picker payloads all
  hold stable `DocumentId`s — closing a buffer can never alias another.
  The parallel-vectors alignment invariant is one `Document` struct now.
- **One selection model** (`strop_core::selection::SelectionSet`):
  normal = collapsed primary, visual = stretched primary, multicursor =
  extras. The three old fields could disagree; the set owns the
  invariants.
- **`MotionShape`** replaces `Range { linewise: bool }`:
  `Characterwise { inclusive }` carries what dfx-vs-dtx need; Blockwise
  is the enum's extension point for visual block.
- **LSP server pool**: one client per (workspace root, server) — Rust +
  Python + C++ in one session, each with its negotiated encoding.
- **Leaf commands are data** (`editor/registry.rs`, plan 0008 stage 1):
  44 normal-mode leaves dispatch from a static table; a parity test
  fuses dispatch and docs. Caught a dormant bug on day one: `W`/`B`/`E`
  never moved the cursor (the grammar's cursor_after lacked BigWord
  arms).
- **`editor/mod.rs` split** (1817 → ~400 lines): document, cursor,
  diagnostics, registers modules; tests live beside the behavior they
  pin. git_memory split into dive/blame/permalink.

### Fixed

- **Paste lands the cursor on the last pasted char** (vim), found by the
  new differential harness.
- **`f`/`t` find multibyte chars** (`f é` works; found bytes before).
  All dynamic command args are `char`, never `u8`.

### Added

- **The nvim differential harness** (0006 tier 1): 40 cases drive strop
  headless and pinned nvim over the same keys; text + cursor must agree.
  Runs in the docker gate.
- **Semantic dot-repeat**: `.` re-resolves the parsed command from the
  current position instead of replaying a key string.
- **ActionPlan**: `strop_grammar::plan(buf, cursors, cmd)` is the single
  object preview renders and execute applies — multicursor previews
  highlight every cursor's target now.
- **Git as four states**: HEAD → index → worktree → live document are
  separate diffable edges. The gutter shows staged lines in the
  committed-adjacent tint; `Space g s` stages (live→index), `Space g S`
  unstages (index→HEAD), `Space g u` discards unstaged (restore from
  index, not HEAD).
- **Selection history**: visual mode `Space g h` = `git log -L` on the
  selected lines. Permalinks from commit surfaces pin that commit.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-04

The safety release. An external architecture review (now `plans/0014`)
audited the mutation and protocol boundaries; every confirmed P0 is
fixed and pinned by a failing-first test.

### Fixed — safety

- **`:wq` could close after a failed save** — disk error, full
  filesystem, or an externally modified file meant silent data loss.
  A failed save now keeps the buffer open and dirty; `:w!`/`:wq!`
  force past an external change.
- **Saves are atomic** (temp file + rename in the same directory,
  permissions preserved) and refuse to overwrite a file that changed
  on disk since load.
- **Readonly is enforced at the mutation boundary**, not by caller
  discipline: `Buffer::insert`/`delete` refuse on readonly buffers;
  job-owned surfaces refresh through an explicit `replace_all_system`.
- **Staging a hunk no longer silently saves the buffer** (writing every
  unrelated unsaved edit to the worktree): dirty buffer →
  "unsaved changes — :w first".
- **Sessions persist on exit**, not only on `:w`.
- **rg failures surface**: a bad `-t`/`--glob` filter posts rg's stderr
  to the picker instead of looking like "no matches".

### Fixed — protocol

- **LSP document versions** strictly increase per document (was: `2`
  forever — pyright rejects stale versions).
- **LSP position encoding** is negotiated (utf-8 offered, utf-16
  honored, the spec default) with one tested conversion module —
  hover/goto/diagnostics land on the right column with emoji,
  combining marks, and astral-plane chars before the point.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`|` is vim's column motion again**; pipe-through-shell moved to
  `Space |` (normal and visual). Restored before the deviation became
  muscle memory — see `plans/0014` §"compatibility policy".

## 0.3.9 — 2026-09-04

Headless QA sweep (the harness now drives the real binary across
60+ scenarios); every crash class found is fixed and pinned by a test.

### Fixed

- **Unicode crash**: word motions classified *bytes*, not chars — `w`
  could park the cursor inside a multibyte char and the next `x`
  panicked ropey. Word classes are char-aware now (é is a word char,
  🦀 isn't), and `x`/`a`/`~` round to char boundaries. Root cause was
  deeper: ropey's `try_byte_to_char` maps mid-char bytes silently, so
  the old `clamp_boundary` never clamped anything — it now verifies via
  the byte↔char roundtrip.
- **Arrow keys did nothing anywhere**: the crossterm translation dropped
  `KeyCode::Up/Down` at the catch-all. Arrows now speak hjkl in normal,
  visual, insert, and on read-only git surfaces; in pickers Up/Down walk
  results and Left/Right move the caret.
- **Picker navigation**: after Esc (normal mode on the field) `j`/`k`
  walk the results instead of editing the query; the prompt glyph shows
  the mode (`❯` insert, `▮` normal).
- **`0` went to line-start nowhere** — the count parser ate the bare
  zero (vim: leading `0` is a motion, later digits are counts).
- **Empty `/` / `?`** repeat the last search (vim) instead of erroring
  with a raw `\r` in the message.
- **Flaky pane tests**: parallel tests shared `/tmp` fixture files;
  fixtures are per-test tempdirs now.

### Added

- **`gs` switches source ↔ header** via clangd's
  `textDocument/switchSourceHeader` — the C/C++ header jump. No server
  or no counterpart says so in the modeline, never silent.

## 0.3.8 — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **The lingering welcome screen**: the untouched initial scratch
  buffer is replaced by the first real thing you open (vim's
  `[No Name]` rule) — no more welcome card reappearing mid-quit, no
  keep-quitting to exit.

### Added

- **Readonly mode** for real: `strop -R file` (vim's `-R`), `:view`
  marks the current buffer readonly, `:view file` opens readonly.
  Modeline shows `[RO]`. (Research note: no editor — vim, nvim, helix —
  opens goto-definition targets readonly by default; editing the
  destination is intentional. `:view`/`-R` is the standard answer.)
- **The modeline grows up**: mode chip · git branch (`*` marks a dirty
  worktree) · file · `[RO]` · cursor count (2×) · error/warning chips ·
  line:col · percent.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Jumplist** (vim's ctrl-o / ctrl-i — and ctrl-i is Tab in a
  terminal, same as vim): jumps record on `gg`/`G`/`%`, searches, `n`/`N`,
  marks, buffer switches, `:N`, and every surface dive; ctrl-o walks
  back across buffers, ctrl-i/Tab forward; a new jump truncates the
  forward path. On commit-diff surfaces Tab keeps its sidebar-focus job.

### Website

- `what's new` links removed (the changelog page serves it);
  docs/changelog content no longer hides under the fixed topbar;
  footers unified with the homepage's.

## 0.3.6 — 2026-09-04

Input boxes get modal, replace gets vscode-grade exclusion, and the LSP
wire learns its manners.

### Fixed

- **didOpen raced initialize** (found while verifying a pyright
  override): the first document opened could hit the wire before
  initialize completed — rust-analyzer tolerates it, strict servers
  (pyright) drop the document. Opens now queue until Initialized; the
  wire reads initialize → initialized → didOpen, textbook.

### Changed

- **Grep is a popup card again**; global **replace keeps the full
  frame** — the quick-lookup and the power-tool get different shapes.

### Added

- **Modal input boxes** (rootle's): picker fields and the `:` `/` `|`
  line land in insert mode; Esc enters vim normal mode *on the field*
  (h/l/0/$/w/b move, x/X delete, i/a/A return), the cursor changes
  shape, Esc again closes. One shared `LineEdit`, no forks.
- **Replace exclusion per file**: ctrl-x excludes a match, ctrl-d
  toggles the row's whole file (vscode's file toggle); the count chip
  counts both; the hint line documents the `-t rs` / `--glob` filters.
- **strop.dev/docs + strop.dev/changelog**: how to configure
  `languages.toml` (project `.strop/` over XDG, helix-shaped, the
  pyright venv+extraPaths recipe) and `config.toml`, plus the full
  per-release changelog.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-09-04

The first-external-review release: a week of real use, seven confirmed
bugs, all fixed.

### Fixed

- **Counts on non-operator commands** never abort anymore: `2x`, `3p`,
  `2u`, `4.`, `3rx`, counted inserts (`3iX` types X three times, `2o`
  repeats the opened line) — vim's multiply rule. (Highest-ranked by
  the reviewer: silent keystroke loss is the worst kind.)
- **`{count}G`** jumps to that line instead of the end of file; bare
  `G` still goes to the end. The two used to disagree silently.
- **`cc`/`S`** clear the line's content and keep the newline + indent
  — no more merging with the next line; counted `2cc` collapses N
  lines into one fresh line (vim semantics).
- **`C`** enters insert at the deletion start, not one column early
  (typed text used to land before the last surviving char).
- **Permalinks with ssh host aliases** (`bbgithub:org/repo.git`)
  resolve via `~/.ssh/config` Host blocks, with a bare-host fallback.
- **Permalink errors say what happened**: not a repo / no remote
  configured / `unsupported remote URL: <it>` — the old
  `no remote / not a repo` conflated all three.
- **`--headless` with a missing script** prints a clean error (exit 2)
  instead of panicking.

### Added

- **`^`** (first non-blank, works with operators: `d^`, `y^`), **`I`**
  (insert there), **`~`** (toggle case, advances), **`S`** (= `cc`).
- **Unknown bare keys are loud**: `not an editor command: <key>` —
  silent swallowing made absent features indistinguishable from broken
  ones.
- **Release attestation**: every release tarball now gets signed
  build provenance (`gh attestation verify <file> -R stropdev/strop`),
  ported from gripsack's pipeline.

### Notes

- The reviewer's https-enterprise permalink failure (their row 5) does
  not reproduce on 0.3.4 — verified with the exact release artifact and
  their exact URL shape. If it still fails for them, the actual remote
  string is the next datum needed.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-09-04

Crash fix and a vim-gap sweep.

### Fixed

- **Replace-picker crash** (`index out of bounds, len 0`): typing in
  `Space R` respawns rg per keystroke; the respawn cleared items but
  not rows, and the renderer indexed a stale row. Rows clear with the
  respawn now, plus defensive lookups (regression test included).
- **Sidebar `│` alignment**: non-current file rows were one column
  wider than the current row — the divider wobbled in and out.
- **`:30`** jumps to a line (clamps to the last content line, never the
  phantom past a trailing newline); **`:noh`** clears the persistent
  search highlight.
- **`30j`-style counts**: `0` after a count digit is a digit, not the
  line-start motion — counts above 9 work now.
- **Visual `<` / `>`** indent and dedent the selection (one undo unit).
- **Visual pending no longer swallows keys**: invalid sequences clear
  with a message instead of accumulating forever (which also made later
  keys vanish).

### Verified

- `.` repeats deletes and change+insert (dot-repeat tests pinned).

## 0.3.3 — 2026-09-04

The git-flow and command-line round, plus a vim-fidelity sweep.

### Added

- **Tab focus-cycle in commit diffs** (tuicr's model): Tab/Shift-Tab
  hops between the file sidebar and the diff content; focused j/k steps
  files in place; the current file wears rootle's `▸` when focused.
- **Syntax highlighting in diff views**: commit deltas highlight code
  under the origin tint (delta's look); the highlighter follows `]f`
  file steps.
- **`:` autocomplete**: ex candidates render under the command card
  with doc strings; Tab cycles them.
- **`:!cmd`**: run a shell command in a job, output opens as a real
  readonly buffer (search it, yank it, q closes).
- **`|cmd` (helix's pipe)**: visual selections pipe through a command
  and get replaced by stdout (one undo unit, never-clobber verified);
  bare `|cmd` pipes the current line.
- **`*` / `#`**: whole-word search for the word under the cursor,
  wrapping; `;` / `,` repeat f/F/t/T finds (`, ` inverts).
- **Persistent search highlight**: matches stay lit after the search
  commits (rootle rule); the current match is underlined. Works on
  readonly surfaces too, with n/N.

### Fixed

- **Undo**: a lone paste never committed its revision — `u` after
  yank+paste claimed "already at oldest change". Every command now
  commits exactly one undo unit (nvim's rule).
- **Ctrl-W on some terminals**: keys that arrive as raw control bytes
  (`\x12`/`\x17`/`\x18`/`\x03`) now map to Ctrl-R/W/X/C — C-w pane
  cycling works on Windows Terminal → WSL.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-09-04

The finish-line polish round: dots, gaps, hues, and a diff that reads
like delta's.

### Added

- **Intra-line emphasis in diffs** (delta-style, two-tier): del/add
  runs pair line-by-line within a hunk, shared prefix/suffix trims, and
  the changed span gets a brighter background + bold over the row tint.
  Pure adds/deletes keep the quiet full-row tint.
- **Blame gaps** (rootle rule): a commit's gutter cell prints only on
  the first line of its run — the blame column breathes.
- **Diagnostics**: severity `●` dot in the gutter (color reads faster
  than letters), colored underline on the offending span
  (`underline_color`; wavy undercurl lands when ratatui bumps to 0.30),
  multiline messages join with ` · ` in the EOL note.
- **`:help` palette**: section-hued key columns (blue normal, purple
  visual, green insert, amber leader, cyan git, yellow ex), section
  headers with a trailing rule, bold keys.

### Fixed

- **Demo hiccup**: the multicursor tape section typed `strop
  proj/demo.rs` into the still-open editor (the splits `:q` closes a
  pane, not the app) and mangled line 1. The tape continues in the
  existing buffer now.

### Decided (research)

- Side-by-side diff (JetBrains-style) is rejected for now — it pairs
  two logical rows into one display row, breaking the surface-as-buffer
  contract (cursor/search/yank mirror). git-delta and tuicr made the
  same call; the run pairing built for emphasis is the alignment engine
  if a split view ever lands (0010 amendment).

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-04

Polish round: the demo is clean again, help wears color, and the E now
tells you what it is.

### Added

- **Diagnostics UX**: the cursor line shows its worst diagnostic as an
  end-of-line note (severity-colored, italic, scoped to one line — no
  inline-hints machinery); severity colors unified across the gutter
  and the note.
- **`:help` decoration**: section headers and key columns in accent,
  planned `(soon)` rows muted.
- Seeded key-soup fuzz test (12k keystrokes across buffer shapes + a
  frame render per shape) — it pays rent immediately (see fixes).

### Fixed

- **async-lsp panic in the demo** ("Sender is alive"): quitting dropped
  the client socket while the server mainloop was still running. The
  runtime thread is now joined on quit (with a leak-not-panic timeout
  fallback).
- **Byte/char units in rope mutations** (found by the fuzz): `insert`,
  `delete`, and history replay passed byte offsets to ropey's char-index
  APIs — any multibyte content (our own undo-tree buffer uses ↵/←/⑂)
  could panic. `delete` also clamps stale ranges instead of panicking.
- **Paste mutated readonly buffers** (found by the fuzz): `p` on a
  git surface or the undo tree now refuses like every other edit.
- Multiline diagnostic messages join with ` · ` in the EOL note.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-04

Multicursor lands, help becomes a buffer, the demo's LSP section is
real again.

### Added

- **Multicursor** (plan 0013, nvim-0.13 interaction over a cascade
  executor): `Q` toggles a cursor at point, `Space c` stacks one onto
  the next line (helix's `C`). Motions, `n`/`N`, operators, yank, paste,
  and insert mode all cascade — deletes apply bottom-up, mirrored edits
  shift-remap, stacked cursors edit once. Normal-mode Esc collapses to
  the primary cursor; `u` reverts a whole cascade as one unit. Secondary
  cursors render as solid blocks. v1 deferrals (visual-mode multi-range,
  mouse placement, select-next-match) are documented in 0013.
- **`:help`** — the keybinding table as a real readonly buffer: `/`
  searches it, motions walk it, `q` closes. `Space ?` opens the same.
  The floating keybinds popup is gone (a buffer you can search beats a
  card you can only scroll).
- Headless `state` now reports `message` and `extra_cursors`.

### Fixed

- **Demo LSP section**: the vhs image now installs a rustup toolchain
  with the `rust-analyzer` + `rust-src` components (apt's rust lacks
  rust-src; the standalone binary half-worked and then errored).
- **Graceful LSP shutdown**: quit sends the `shutdown`/`exit` sequence —
  every session used to end with the server dying "client exited
  without proper shutdown" and a fake failure on the statusline.
- **vim fidelity: `cw`/`cW`** resolve like `ce`/`cE` — the trailing
  whitespace is no longer eaten, and at a word's last char only that
  word changes (pinned in the grammar contract tests).
- Commit-diff sidebar width fits the file list (clamped 12–24) instead
  of a fixed 28 columns.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-09-03

Hardening + daily-driver release. The crash-on-quit class is dead, the
editor opens directories, the system clipboard works, and the git
surfaces got the rootle-grade navigation treatment.

### Fixed (trust)

- **Quit crash**: `:q`/`:q!`/`:wq` on the last buffer with an LSP
  attached panicked in the post-feed drain (`lsp_sync_changed` indexed
  an emptied buffer list). The TUI breaks on `should_quit` before the
  drains now, and the sync is empty-list-safe. This was visible in the
  demo tape.
- Panic hook restores the terminal (raw mode + alt screen) on any crash.
- Hunk-restore underflows at file top (`Space g u` on a hunk at line 0).
- Undo cursor lands at the start of the undone change (vim semantics),
  not the tail of the replayed op list; redo distinguishes insert/delete
  placement. History replay clamps both bounds to char boundaries.
- `n`/`N` actually work now — the keymap advertised search repeat with
  no dispatch behind it (found by the new coverage test).

### Added

- **Directory open**: `strop dir/` cds and lands on the file picker
  (helix's `hx .`) instead of dying on EISDIR.
- **System clipboard**: `Space y` / `Space p` / `Space P` (helix-style)
  on top of vim's `"+` register — yank stages OSC52 (works over ssh),
  paste reads via wl-paste/xclip/xsel/pbpaste off the input path.
- **Global replace** (plan 0007): `Space R` — two fields, live
  replacement preview per row, `ctrl-x` excludes a match, Enter applies
  with one undo revision per buffer, span-verified and mtime-guarded,
  atomic file writes. Grep queries take rg filters (`-t rs`,
  `--glob '!target/*'`). Grep and replace render full-frame.
- **Undo-tree browser**: `Space u` — the revision tree as a real
  readonly buffer; Enter restores any revision (branches included), q
  closes.
- **Blame gutter** (0011): `Space g b` toggles a left-margin blame
  column (`sha · author · age`); Enter on a line dives into that line's
  commit. The blame card stays as the loading fallback.
- **Commit diff sidebar**: a commit's file delta shows the changed-files
  list in a left sidebar (tuicr-style); `]f` / `[f` step through the
  commit's files in place.
- **Surface stack** (0011): q/close on any git surface restores the
  origin buffer unconditionally, works in splits, and stale job results
  are generation-guarded.
- **Project LSP config** (0012): `.strop/languages.toml` over XDG
  `languages.toml` over the embedded registry — helix-flavored
  `[language-server.NAME.config]` passthrough (pyright `extraPaths`
  works), absolute commands skip the PATH probe, server capabilities now
  gate hover/goto.
- **Syntax**: fish, lua, sql grammars + vendored highlight queries; cpp
  uses the vendored query now; extensionless shell scripts resolve by
  basename (`.bashrc`, `PKGBUILD`) and shebang.
- **Commit graph lanes**: the log surface colors each graph lane
  distinctly, nodes bold in their lane color.

### Changed

- The keybinds popup (`Space ?`) and all which-key cards render from the
  one `keymap.rs` table; a coverage test pins every dispatchable
  sequence to a row (0003 §5.7). "(soon)" rows render muted as planned,
  never as live.
- Picker previews read files on worker threads — no more blocking IO in
  the render path (0001 §3).

### Plans

- New: 0011 surface stack, 0012 project config, 0013 multicursor
  (nvim-0.13 interaction over helix machinery — the next big rock).
- Amended: 0005/0009 (config filename reconciliation), 0007 (status +
  form-factor notes).
